# Grocery List Workshop

## Bare Minimum Requirements
1. Allow a user to add items and their quantities to the grocery list.
2. Allow a user to increment/decrement the amount of a grocery item by clicking on an appropriate button.
3. Allow a user to clear a grocery item from the current list.
4. Allow a user to reset the current list.

## Advanced Content (optional)
1. Require a user to input both the item name and quantity before adding to the grocery list.
2. When a user tries to add an item with the same name, send the user an alert informing the user that the item already exists. Do not use the browser's built-in .alert() method.
3. Allow users to reorder their list of grocery items.
4. When a user wants to clear out an item from their list, grey out the item and move the item to the bottom of the list rather than removing the item from the list.
